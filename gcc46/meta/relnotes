ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
After installation the fixed-includes should be regenerated.
Go to /usr/tgcware/libexec/gcc/<platform>/<version>/install-tools and run
the mkheaders program.

Note that the libstdc++ abi_check fails in the testsuite when built for
sparc v8 since the __sync_compare_and_swap family of builtins are not
implemented for this cpu (missing CAS or similar instruction).
This results in 22 missing symbols in libstdc++ compared to the baseline that
the testsuite uses.
